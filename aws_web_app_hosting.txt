Create 5 multiple choice questions concerning the following content, each with 5 options, and display the answer to each question below the options. Traditional on-premises web architectures require complex solutions and accurate reserved capacity forecast in order to ensure reliability. Dense peak traffic periods and wild swings in traffic patterns result in low utilization rates of expensive hardware. This yields high operating costs to maintain idle hardware, and an inefficient use of capital for underused hardware. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a reliable, scalable, secure, and highly performing infrastructure for the most demanding web applications. This infrastructure matches IT costs with customer traffic patterns in near-real time. Scalable web hosting is a well-known problem space. The following image depicts a traditional web hosting architecture that implements a common three-tier web application model. In this model, the architecture is separated into presentation, application, and persistence layers. Scalability is provided by adding hosts at these layers. The architecture also has built-in performance, failover, and availability features. The traditional web hosting architecture is easily ported to the AWS Cloud with only a few modifications.
